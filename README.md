# Trading managment #

## Tosen is a trading management system ##

I do a lot of CFD trading and it became a pain to work out risk and reward, how much I would get out if a trade reached my target, including all fees and specific gearing for that instrument. I wrote Tosen to keep track of all the trades that I do, and to see if any of them were triggered, and how many were successful and not.

This can be easily extended to include more than CFDs, different brokers, custom fees, and custom graphing.
